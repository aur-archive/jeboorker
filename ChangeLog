	* 0.3.9-1 :
	Bugfixes: Metadata downloader did not writes the cover image into the document 
	if the document did not already have a cover (The cover downloader does).
        Database: Exchanges the underlying database system. Now using H2 instead of OrientDB. 
        I run into too many bugs with OrientDB to getting Jeboorker running stable.
        GUI: Implemented the great looking //Web Look and Feel// and made it as the default look and feel.
